Monitoring
For the monitoring of Servers
The use of FAN Fully Automated Nagios
Linux, AIX, Unix -> nagios with ssh or snmp queries.
Windows -> nagios with wmi_plus.pl, wmic, winexe or snmp queries.
Switches, Routers -> nagios with snmp queries.
Basically, nagios with a web page over the top for configuration purposes.
Can be configured as All in One system or Split into a multinode system.
I have used it both as All in One. 
I have used it as a split system.
Database Server - MySQL server, stores configuration and current status of Hosts and Services.
Poller Server - executes scripts against the remote hosts to gather information about them.
Central Server - web server, graphing server(rrd), stores historic data in rrd files, receives all results from pollers and sends results to database server.
Reporting, Dashboards
There are some built in reports and dashboards in FAN.  
But, you can come up with some elaborate reporting/dashboards using MySql queries and use rrdtool for graphing.

Checks,
For windows, rely firstly on the check_wmi_plus.pl software for it's built in ability to monitor windows servers.
Documentation already inside FAN, run this.  /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_wmi_plus.pl
It will spit back a HEAP of options of how to use it.
