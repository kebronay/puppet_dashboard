#Install MySQL Server
======================
The puppet dashboard stores data in a mysql database, so lets install it, start it and set a root mysql password. Here we’re using “XXXXXXX(chose pass)” for the password.

yum -y install mysql-server
/etc/init.d/mysqld start
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'XXXXXXX(chose pass)'
Create database for puppet dashboard
We’ll create a database called puppetdash and a user called puppdash with a password of XXXXXXX(chose pass) to connect to it.

echo "create database puppetdash;" | mysql -uroot -pXXXXXXX(chose pass)
echo "grant all on puppetdash.* to puppdash@localhost identified by 'XXXXXXX(chose pass)';" | mysql -uroot -pXXXXXXX(chose pass)
echo "flush privileges;" | mysql -uroot -pXXXXXXX(chose pass)
# install puppetlabs repo

rpm -ivhhttp://yum.puppetlabs.com/el/6/products/x86_64/puppetlabs-release-6-1.noarch.rpm
# install dashboard from yum now

yum -y install puppet-dashboard
cp /usr/share/puppet-dashboard/config/settings.yml.example /usr/share/puppet-dashboard/config/settings.yml
nano -w /usr/share/puppet-dashboard/config/database.yml
Make the whole file look like this

production:
  database: puppetdash         
  username: puppdash
  password: XXXXXXX(chose pass)
  encoding: utf8
  adapter: mysql
development:
  database: puppetdash         
  username: puppdash
  password: XXXXXXX(chose pass)
  encoding: utf8
  adapter: mysql
cd /usr/share/puppet-dashboard
rake db:migrate
/etc/init.d/puppet-dashboard start
# add reporting to puppet.conf

echo "    report = true" >> /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
echo "" >> /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
echo "[master]" >> /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
echo "    reports = store, http" >> /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
echo "    reporturl = http://x.x.x.x(ec2 publicDNS):3000/reports/upload" >> /etc/puppet/puppet.conf
Run puppet manually
We run puppet manually to make sure it sends a report to the dashboard.

puppetd -t
chown puppet-dashboard /usr/share/puppet-dashboard/log/
/sbin/chkconfig puppet-dashboard on
/sbin/chkconfig puppet-dashboard-workers on
/sbin/chkconfig mysqld on
/etc/init.d/puppet-dashboard restart
/etc/init.d/puppet-dashboard-workers restart
